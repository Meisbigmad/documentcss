Though you're documenting your styles, the tool you'll be using is DocumentJS. [Documentjs.com](https://documentjs.com) is developer focused though, and can be hard to read and use as a designer. These guides are intended to help clear those issues and introduce design-focused features.

There are four guides, each written for specific cases:
1. [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart.html)
2. [How to Use DocumentCSS](docs/using.html)
3. [How to Customize the Documentation]()
