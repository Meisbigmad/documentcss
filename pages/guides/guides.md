Though you're documenting your styles, the tool you'll be using is DocumentJS. [Documentjs.com](https://documentjs.com) is developer focused though, and can be hard to read and use as a designer. These guides are intended to help clear those issues and introduce design-focused features.

There are four guides, each written for specific cases:
1. [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart.html)
2. [Adding to Existing JS Docs](/docs/lsg-adding.html)
3. [Creating a Standalone Live Style Guide](/docs/standalone-lsg.html)
4. [Publishing Your Styleguide](/docs/publishing.html)
